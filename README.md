# Unsupervised Learning

IN PROGRESS: The following project will take an unsupervised learning approach using the Online Retail dataset. This dataset was taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Reposity. It can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). I chose this dataset, firstly, because it lacks a clear target variable (i.e. purchase yes/no), but also because it includes some behavioral variables (i.e. product type, quantity of product, cost, time of purchase). I will be addressing datasets and useful models for behavioral variables in later projects, but wanted to have the opportunity to experiment with an unsupervised approach. Chen, Sain, and Guo (2012) used k-means clustering on this dataset using SAS. The article makes no explicit mention of using the elbow curve method or silhouette analysis to determine the number of clusters. Those methods will be used here (assuming there might not be a huge difference from SAS applied models, it still might be interesting).

Throughout the process, I noted some differences within the structure of the data available to the Chen, Sain, and Guo (2012) article. Notably, the presence of a Customer ID column, with missing values. Within my analysis, I handled those values based on their description accordingly. I noted that Chen, Sain, and Guo (2012) preprocessed/ analyzed their data within the context of the frequency and monetary model (RFM). This is a classic data mining approach, which provides profitable insights into key segmentations of customer data. For this project, I preprocess the data into the same key dimensions: Recency, Frequency, Monetary. Because the analysis is done within Python, not SAS, I also have the flexibility here to apply optimization techniques (i.e. Elbow Cruve method - Silhoutte Algorithm), experimenting with their impact on the analysis. Finally, there is a potential within the data set to dive a bit deeper into the RFMT (T for time), looking at an additional dimension of time since first purchase, with this data set. I will see if this has any meaningful outcomes on the analysis here.
