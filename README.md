# Unsupervised Learning

The following project will take an unsupervised learning approach using the Online Retail dataset. This dataset was taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Reposity. It can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). I chose this dataset, firstly, because it lacks a clear target variable (i.e. purchase yes/no), but also because it includes some behavioral variables (i.e. product type, quantity of product, cost, time of purchase). I will be addressing datasets and useful models for behavioral variables in later projects, but wanted to have the opportunity to experiment with an unsupervised approach. Chen, Sain, and Guo (2012) used k-means clustering on this dataset using SAS. The article makes no explicit mention of using the elbow curve method or silhouette analysis to determine the number of clusters. Those methods will be used here (assuming there might not be a huge difference from SAS applied models, it still might be interesting)..
